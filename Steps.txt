## Update the system
sudo yum update -y
## Install ansible, python, and pip
sudo yum install ansible python3-pip -y
## Install boto3 using pip3
pip3 install boto3
## go to the ansible folder and create hosts file to add the hosts. By adding the host, when we perform a playbook to create infra, it will be created using the added hosts.
cd /etc/ansible
sudo touch hosts
## edit the file hosts and add the required hosts
sudo vim hosts
ex:
[web1]
w1 ansible_host=privateip ansible_user=ec2-user or ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=path of the key
## To connect to the host we need the key so use scp from your local machine to push the key 
As you can see I have got the pem file
give the UbuAdi.pem file the required permissions
sudo chmod 400 UbuAdi.pem
Once the required permissions and the hosts are given:
1. we need to go to the Host-1 from the Master server and install python, pip and boto3 on the host servers for the ansbile-playbooks to work.
2. ssh -i key ec2-user@Pub-ip-of-host-1
3. sudo yum update -y; sudo yum install python3-pip -y
pip3 install boto3
Once installed exit back to master and continue creating the infrastructure using ansible playbooks
Once you have installed ansible, python, pip, and boto3 on the master server.
And also installed python, pip, and boto3 on the host-1 server.
In the master server, we start creating the ansible playbooks for the creation of the aws infrastructure.
Create a yaml file
touch infra.yml 
Add the required resources to the yaml file for creation of the aws infrastructure
